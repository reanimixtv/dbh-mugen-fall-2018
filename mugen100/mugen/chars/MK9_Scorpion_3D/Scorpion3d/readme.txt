MK1 Scorpion Ending by Dchan250

This is an add-on for OMEGAPSYCHO's amazingly done MK1 Scorpion. 

How to insert into MK1 Scorpion:
Put all the files in the CODE folder. Then paste this:

[Arcade]
intro.storyboard=
ending.storyboard=CODE\ending.def

Have fun!

Credits:
OMEGAPSYCHO: For creating those awesome MK characters!
Plasmoidthunder: For re-indexing the ending storyboard's palette.

I, am in no way taking credit for OMEGAPSYCHO's work.
