Random notes
All the code in this char is open-source, except the ones that aren't made by me, as well.
I made this char for myself, my characters have their own customization. If you don't like... I don't care! Hahaha >=D
If you find any bug, PLEASE contact-me.
About Dark Force, Akuma's attack power decreases 25%, but Akuma power attack + clone power attack = 150% >=D. Also, some moves can not be used (super moves, Charge power, zero counter, guard push...)
People, sorry, my english is very very very bad =P


Changes since last version (v.075):
Fix several bugs
2 new winposes
2 .def files: AkumaDM.def and AkumaDM_noAI.def


What's missing:
Misogi, Kongou Kokuretsu Zan and some other moves;
Groove select, maybe;
Fix random bugs;
And so on. I'm too lazy to remember all =P
